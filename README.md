## Visualization Analysis of COVID-19 Impacts on Air-traffic Volume
This interactive data visualization is designed using Python Bokeh to explore the correlation between the rate of spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and the air-traffic volume in the United States.

The COVID-19 positive cases and the air-traffic volume in the United States datasets used in this interactive data visualization were obtained from the opne-source repository Kaggle:
- [COVID-19 positive cases](https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/covid19-in-usa)
- [Air-traffic volume in USA](https://www.kaggle.com/terenceshin/covid19s-impact-on-airport-traffic)
